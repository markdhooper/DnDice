# DnDice
A simple dice rolling application for use in tabletop RPGs

You can use the presets to automatically roll up to 10 different dice. I still need to add d10's. Also would like to add a sum in the top right to help out the rogues with adding up all of the d6 results. Just a tool that I wanted in my games that looks prettier than the WOTC version, and allows me to have presets.
